    <ol>
        <li  class="Lists">Heat oil in a large frying pan. Add onion and garlic, cooking for 5 minutes until softened. Next, add mince and brown thoroughly.</li>
        <li  class="Lists">Stir in tomatoes and sprinkle dried oregano over the mixture. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li  class="Lists">Preheat oven to 180°C and grease a medium ovenproof baking dish. Arrange ¼ of the Lasagna sheets on the base, trimming them as needed to fit.</li>
        <li  class="Lists">Spoon 1/3 of the mince mixture over the Lasagna sheets and cover with a generous layer of béchamel sauce. Repeat the layering process twice more. Top the final layer of béchamel sauce with Lasagna sheets and spread the remaining béchamel over them.</li>
        <li  class="Lists">Sprinkle cheese over the top and bake for 30-40 minutes until the pasta is tender and cheese turns golden brown. If needed, cover the dish with foil during baking to prevent the cheese from burning.</li>
